These plots show the effect of down-sampling on richness estimates at each site, grouped by year of sampling. The top plot shows points as the average estimate at each down-sampled survey for the sampling distance shown on the x-axis. The lines are polynomial smooths to show the trend. The size of each point is in proportion to the variance of the species richness estimate for each random sub-sample at the specified level of sampling. Facets are arranged based on the greatest reduction in species richness as a percentage of the total.

```{r}
column(12, 
  column(3, 
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/richex.jpg'),
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here('figs/richex.jpg'))
```

These plots are similar to the above, but richness is scaled as a percentage of the total at full sample effort. This allows for a comparison of a reduction in the estimate independent of the overall species richness. That is, the sensitivity of the richness estimate at a site may vary depending on overall species richness.

```{r}
column(12, 
  column(3, 
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/richperex.jpg'),
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here('figs/richperex.jpg'))
```

There is some evidence that a greater reduction in species richness is expected at sites with higher richness, although the model is insignificant.

```{r}
column(12, 
  column(3, 
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/richloss.jpg'),
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.align: "center"
#| out.width: "70%"
knitr::include_graphics(here('figs/richloss.jpg'))
